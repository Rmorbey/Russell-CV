## A bit about me ( my "this is your life" moment )
  
</div>

I'm a personable, creative and detail focused Full Stack Software Developer. As well as in general an all round supporter of people, and I am a recent [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (April '22 intake).

When not doing the above I also eat pizza, plays games and practice singing songs as Kermit the frog.

Before taking the leap into software devlopement I worked at various Special Educational Needs Schools across london over an 8 year period. Over that time I was able to help support the most vulnerable children and young adults develop their emotional and social skills, as well as teach them how to build independance and develop work place skills to help them obtain future employment. I ran communication lessons for non-verbal students, and watching them interact with the games I had made, and the progress they achieved with their verbal communication.

In my own education I graduated from East 15 Acting school with a first class degree in Acting and Contemporary Theatre. Where I spent 4 years developing my own skills of collaboration, team work, flexibility and an understanding of self worth. I participated in a range of company led productions, devising, writing and creating puppetry from scratch without any prior knowledge using obscure textbooks and old images to build puppets from cardboard, foam and wire coat hangers.

What excites me most about tech is the seemingly unlimited potential to develop software that will have a positive impact on its users and the people around them. Software that can support people from all walks of life, especially for those who are overlooked. My future personal projects are to build the pen and paper learning resources I made for my non-verbal students, but as interactive and accessible web/mobile apps.

## What I excel at ( Skills )

#### An excellent communicator, presenter with strong timekeeping skills  ####

* I lead communication lessons for mainly non-verbal students. Where I broke down the basic components of social communication into tailor made accessible resources and interactive games. Which resulted in the students verbal communication growing over a period of time and to reach a place where they could successfully verbally communicate simple sentences.

* I provided support and workshops for colleagues in how to use our own personal talents to structure communication lessons so the students felt safe in a productive learning environment. 

#### A dedicated, adaptive, problem solver ####

* Going from in person teaching to at the drop of a hat creating interactive online resources for students to access remotely during the pandemic.

* Adapting in person classes into video tutorials on independent skills, making the bed, making breakfast, making a cup of tea, washing the dishes, hoovering the flat, check ins and emotional regulation. This provided structure and reassurance in a world that can quickly change.

* Understanding the ever changing needs of the specific students, and tailoring resources for them. Building a communication board that allowed a specfic student to build simple sentences with word-image cards to allow them to simplify their verbal process so they felt empowered to have their needs met.

#### A creative, detail orientated, quick learner who works on his feet ####

* I've worked on several different productions that required different forms and styles of pupperty. Built entirely from scratch, usually from studying an image, or source material and spending a large amount of time thoroughly planning how it would function and how the performer intended to use it. From building a simple mechanical parrot handle umbrella for a show about Mary poppins, to constructing three cardboard Bunraku styled puppets for a telling of Shakespeare's Richard III.

* While working full time as an SEN TA, I would also be juggling learning lines for productions on a short time scale. Often having to be off script in under a day or two, as well as doing the required research to fully fulfill the characters needs and journey.

* Working in a devised, movement and clowning based practice, I had to be ready to adapt and be quick on my toes. Being able to react and develop ideas and impulses in a group of performers while building a harmonious product.

## Where I've been learning ( Education )

#### Makers Academy (April 2022 Cohort)

Full-time 16 week intensive software development bootcamp focusing on:

* Object-Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, Model View Controller design patterns, DRY and SRP principles.
* Agile principles, pair programming, stand-ups, retros and sprint planning.
* Various computer based languages such as Ruby and JavaScript.
* Group based projects to develop our programming skills in a workplace environment.
* Sharing knowledge as a Mentor to students in newer cohorts.

#### East 15 Acting School (2009 to 2013)

* First Class degree in BA Acting and Contemporary Theatre.
* Subjects included. Devising, clowning, voice over, dance, physical theatre, puppetry, singing, movement, gymnastics, script writing and directing.

## Where I've Worked ( Experience )

**Samuel Rhodes School** (Feb-2020 to Dec-2021)  
_Class Room Teaching Assistant_

* Working with secondary and college aged students with a range of special educational needs and disabilities.
* Lead Class TA and 1:1 with students to provide a safe and nurturing environment in which the students could excel and feel self empowered.
* Led communication and self independence lessons where I built tailor made resources from scratch.

**Sugarman Education** (Dec-2013 to Feb-2020)  
_Agency Class Room Teaching Assistant_

* Worked with primary and secondary aged students with a range of special educational needs and disabilities, as well as emotional needs.
* Worked at a range of different schools from primay SEN, primary mainstream 1:1 with an SEN pupil. To secondary SEN pupil referral units dealing with behaviour as well as social and emotional skills.


## What I do for fun ( Hobbies )

* **Reading:** I like to read sci-fy and fantasy novels, I'm eagerly awaiting Patrick Rothfuss' highly anticipated "The Doors of Stone." as well as Pierce Brown's final book in the Red Rising Saga "Lightbringer".
* **Board/Table top games:** Current favourite board game is "The Quacks of Quedlinburg." where you play as charlatans or quack doctors brewing potions adding ingredients one at a time. I also enjoy communal story telling games and RPGs, such as "D&D", "Call of Cthulhu" as well as "Ten Candles". 
* **Video games:** Currently sailing the seven seas as a rag tag crew of salty sea dogs in "Sea of Thieves" coordinating plundering, riddle solving and treasure hunting with friends from a far.
* **Bouldering:** Mastering the basics from V0 to V3 while socialising with friends and strangers a like. Building that all needed hand strength for improved code writing.
* **Table Tennis:** A social player who gets increasingly competative the longer the game goes on. Helluva a serve, but I've been told I hold the racket weird.
