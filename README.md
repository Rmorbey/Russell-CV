## A bit about me ( my "this is your life" moment )
  
</div>

I'm a personable, creative and detail focused Software Engineer. As well as in general an all round supporter of people, and I am a recent [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (April '22 intake).

When not doing the above I also search for, and then eat, the best vegan pizza in London, play games and practice singing songs as Kermit the frog.

Before taking the leap into software development I worked at various Special Educational Needs Schools across London over an 8 year period. I ran communication lessons for non-verbal students, and watching them interact with the games I made, and getting to see the progress they achieved with their social skills and verbal communication was extremely rewarding.

I graduated from East 15 Acting school with a first class BA degree in Acting and Contemporary Theatre. Where I spent 4 years developing my own skills of collaboration, team work, flexibility and an understanding of self worth.

While working in schools I got my first glimpse into the world of coding and software development. I would assist the students in an hour of code a week. We built a lego robot and were able to control it's movements using simple lines of code.

After working through the pandemic and realising that I wanted a change of career, I started to look into the possibility of re training as a software engineer. Combining my interests of building things and the possibility of tech led me to start my journey with Makers.

What excites me most about tech is the seemingly unlimited potential to develop software that will have a positive impact on its users and the people around them. Software that can support people from all walks of life, especially for those who are overlooked. My future personal projects are to build the pen and paper learning resources I made for my non-verbal students, but as interactive and accessible web/mobile apps.

## What I excel at ( Skills )

### An excellent communicator, presenter with strong timekeeping skills  ###

##### <ins>Communication/Timekeeping skills:</ins> #####

* I led communication lessons for mainly non-verbal students.
* Where I broke down the basic components of social communication into tailor made accessible resources and interactive games.

* Addressing issues within the team dynamic.
* Helping to communicate ideas and alternative ways of thinking.
* Broke down daily goals and achivements into organised and focused tasks.

##### <ins>Presenter skills:</ins> #####

* Colleagues felt more comfortable and confident while leading lessons.
* Students achieved more and progressed faster.

##### <ins>How I implemented these into a tech environment:</ins> #####

* As Project Manager, I was able to ascertain the strengths and interests of our team.
* Encourage my team to use the skills they had to help to accomplish our daily tasks and goals.
* Identifying team members having blockers and reassuring them.

### A dedicated, adaptive, problem solver ###

##### <ins> Dedicated / Adaptive skills:</ins> #####

* Going from in person teaching to at the drop of a hat creating interactive online resources for students to access remotely during the pandemic.
* Adapting in person classes into video tutorials on independent skills as well as virtual check ins and emotional regulation. 
* This provided structure and reassurance in a world that can quickly change. 

##### <ins>How I implemented these into a tech environment:</ins> #####

*  Consistent check ins on emotional state before starting work in a pair.
*  Identifying blockers or imposter syndrome and allowing space to discuss them in a non judgmental environment.

##### <ins>Problem Solver skills:</ins> #####

* Understanding the ever changing needs of the specific students, and tailoring resources for them.
* Building a communication board that allowed a specific student to build simple sentences with word-image cards to allow them to simplify their verbal process so they felt empowered to have their needs met. 
* I saw that the student was struggling, and we weren't being as accessible as we could.
* So I took the initiative to build and deliver the resources needed for him to communicate both verbally and non-verbally if needed. 

##### <ins>How I implemented these into a tech environment:</ins> #####

* Identifying my team was struggling with blockers, and work fatigue.
* While running the end of day retro I suggested we played a game of online pictionary.
* This raised spirits and gave our minds a break from the blockers we were facing, and we ended the day on a good note.

### A creative, detail orientated, quick learner who works on his feet ###

##### <ins>Detail orientated skills:</ins> #####

* Built different styles of puppetry entirely from scratch.

## Where I've Worked ( Experience )

**Goodlord** (Oct-2022 to Jan-2023)
_Software Engineering Intern_

##### <ins>Adaptable skills:</ins> #####

* While on the intern academy I was able to adapt to new software languages and challenges quickly. Getting a quick understanding and able to add value. Working on different tickets that required using different languages. I.e. python, ruby, JS, TS, C#, react and PHP.

**Samuel Rhodes School** (Feb-2020 to Dec-2021)
_Class Room Teaching Assistant_

##### <ins>Empathy skills:</ins> #####

* Working with secondary and college aged students with a range of special educational needs and disabilities. 
* Being neurodiverse myself and displaying my own personal skills I showed them that no matter their diagnosis, everyone has a personal basket of skills that are just as valid and valued as others.
* The student's confidence grew, and they achieved things even they couldn't have imagined.

##### <ins>Leadership skills:</ins> #####

* Lead Class TA and 1:1 with students to provide a safe and nurturing environment in which the students could excel and feel self empowered.
* I was often tasked with training and mentoring new TA's. 
* Provided feedback to higher management and the TA I was training, so the students accessibility needs were our top priority.
* This helped maintain a culture of constant improvement and development for everyone.

##### <ins>Initiative skills:</ins> #####

* Led communication and self independence lessons where I built and delivered tailor made resources from scratch.
* I also made resources that visually showed the students class structure, and broke their daily tasks down into simple to understand chunks. 
* I was asked to deliver my resources to other classrooms, so the students were provided with coherent structure across all subjects. 
* This caused the students to engage more in classes and to alleviate anxiety within the students.

**Sugarman Education** (Dec-2013 to Feb-2020)
_Agency Class Room Teaching Assistant_

##### <ins>Adaptability skills:</ins> #####

* Worked with primary and secondary aged students with a range of special educational needs and disabilities, as well as emotional needs.
* I was able to work in a range of different schools and environments that would often change from day to day. 
* Students warmed to me quickly, and I was often asked to return on several occasions. 
* This resulted in the students staying focused and showing no signs of anxiety around change.

##### <ins>Resilience / Compassion skills:</ins> #####

* Worked at a range of different schools from primary SEN to secondary SEN pupil referral units dealing with behaviour.
* Using my skills I was able to withstand threats and attacks, of being hit, bit or spat on, while still reassuring the student that they weren't in trouble and that everything was going to be alright. 
* On several occasions I was able to defuse situations between two students which would have ended up putting the students safety in danger.

## What I do for fun ( Hobbies )

* **Reading:** I like to read sci-fy and fantasy novels, I'm eagerly awaiting Patrick Rothfuss' highly anticipated "The Doors of Stone." as well as Pierce Brown's final books in the Red Rising Saga "Lightbringer" and secret 7th book, "Red God".
* **Board/Table top games:** Current favourite board game is "The Quacks of Quedlinburg." where you play as charlatans or quack doctors brewing potions adding ingredients one at a time. I also enjoy communal story telling games and RPGs, such as "D&D", "Call of Cthulhu" as well as "Ten Candles". 
* **Video games:** Currently sailing the seven seas as a rag tag crew of salty sea dogs in "Sea of Thieves" coordinating plundering, riddle solving and treasure hunting with friends from a far.
* **Bouldering:** Mastering the basics from V0 to V3 while socialising with friends and strangers a like. Building that all needed hand strength for improved code writing.
* **Table Tennis:** A social player who gets increasingly competative the longer the game goes on. Helluva a serve, but I've been told I hold the racket weird.
