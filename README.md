## About me
  
</div>

I'm a 32 year old supporter of people, and I am a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (April '22 intake).

Before taking the leap into software devlopement I worked at various Special Educational Needs Schools across london over a 9 year period. Over that time I was able to help support the most vulnerable children and young adults develop their emotional and social skills, as well as teach them how to build independance and develop work place skills to help them obtain future employment.

In my own education I graduated from East 15 Acting school with a first class degree in Contemporary Theatre. Where I spent 4 years developing my own skills of collaboration, team work, flexibility and an understanding of self worth.

What excites me most about tech is the seemingly unlimited potential to develop software that will have a positive impact on its users and the people around them. Software that can support people from all walks of life, especially for those who are overlooked.
