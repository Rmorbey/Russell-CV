## A bit about me ( my "this is your life" moment )
  
</div>

I'm a personable, creative and detail focused Full Stack Software Developer. As well as in general an all round supporter of people, and I am a recent [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate (April '22 intake).

When not doing the above I also eat pizza, plays games and practice singing songs as Kermit the frog.

Before taking the leap into software developement I worked at various Special Educational Needs Schools across london over an 8 year period. Over that time I was able to help support the most vulnerable children and young adults develop their emotional and social skills, as well as teach them how to build independance and develop work place skills to help them obtain future employment. I ran communication lessons for non-verbal students, and watching them interact with the games I had made, and the progress they achieved with their verbal communication.

In my own education I graduated from East 15 Acting school with a first class degree in Acting and Contemporary Theatre. Where I spent 4 years developing my own skills of collaboration, team work, flexibility and an understanding of self worth.

While working in schools I got my first glimpse into the world of coding and software development where I would assist the students in an hour of code a week. We built a lego robot and were able to control it's movements using simple lines of code. I've always liked building things, and found the interaction between the two interesting. After working through the pandemic and realising that I wanted a change of career to something where I could work remotely and possibly from anywhere in the world, I started to look into the possibility of re training as a software developer. Combining my interests of building things and the possibility of tech led me to start my journey with Makers.

What excites me most about tech is the seemingly unlimited potential to develop software that will have a positive impact on its users and the people around them. Software that can support people from all walks of life, especially for those who are overlooked. My future personal projects are to build the pen and paper learning resources I made for my non-verbal students, but as interactive and accessible web/mobile apps.

## What I excel at ( Skills )

#### An excellent communicator, presenter with strong timekeeping skills  ####

* I led communication lessons for mainly non-verbal students. Where I broke down the basic components of social communication into tailor made accessible resources and interactive games. Which resulted in the students verbal communication growing over a period of time and to reach a place where they could successfully verbally communicate simple sentences. These skills helped me in leading daily standups and retros during our projects at Makers. This enabled our team to understand our daily goals and achievements and kept us organised and focused on our specific tasks.

* I provided support and workshops for colleagues in how to use our own personal talents to structure communication lessons so the students felt safe in a productive learning environment. This skill helped during our final project while acting as Project Manager as I was able to ascertain the strengths and interests of our team and encourage them to use the skills they had to help to accomplish our daily tasks and goals. It also helped when blockers would appear so I was able to reassure my team member that their individual skills were an asset and were vital to the progression of our project so far.

#### A dedicated, adaptive, problem solver ####

* Going from in person teaching to at the drop of a hat creating interactive online resources for students to access remotely during the pandemic. Adapting in person classes into video tutorials on independent skills, making the bed, making breakfast, making a cup of tea, washing the dishes, hoovering the flat, check ins and emotional regulation. This provided structure and reassurance in a world that can quickly change. These skills helped during our projects and while pair programming, while over coming blockers or feelings of imposter syndrome. Checking in with peoples emotional states and having open and honest conversation helped us progress even when blockers appeared.

* Understanding the ever changing needs of the specific students, and tailoring resources for them. Building a communication board that allowed a specfic student to build simple sentences with word-image cards to allow them to simplify their verbal process so they felt empowered to have their needs met. I saw that the student was struggling, and we weren't being as accessible as we could. So I took the initiative to build and deliver the resources needed for him to communicate both verbally and non-verbally if needed. During our final project after a day of blockers the group was feeling dejected. While running the end of day retro I suggested we played a game of online pictionary to raise spirits and give our minds a break from the blockers we were facing.

#### A creative, detail orientated, quick learner who works on his feet ####

* I've worked on several different productions that required different forms and styles of pupperty. Built entirely from scratch, usually from studying an image, or source material and spending a large amount of time thoroughly planning how it would function and how the performer intended to use it. From building a simple mechanical parrot handle umbrella for a show about Mary poppins, to constructing three cardboard Bunraku styled puppets for a telling of Shakespeare's Richard III. These skills helped me during my projects, because of my eye for detail I was able to fix bugs, find mistakes and assist with errors. This helped in building good quality, well tested code.

* While working full time as an SEN TA, I would also be juggling learning lines for productions on a short time scale. Often having to be off script in under a day or two, as well as doing the required research to fully fulfill the characters needs and journey. These skills helped while learning new languages and frameworks. On one of our projects I was given a seed project to work from in a framework I had never seen before. I was able to build an understanding around it in a few days, especially learning from testing it.

* Working in a devised, movement and clowning based practice, I had to be ready to adapt and be quick on my toes. Being able to react and develop ideas and impulses in a group of performers while building a harmonious product. The skills of collaboration helped during my projects as I was able to quickly adapt and work with different pairing partners as well as change course from one way of thinking to another.

## Where I've been learning ( Education )

#### Makers Academy (April 2022 Cohort)

Full-time 16 week intensive software development bootcamp focusing on:

* Object-Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, Model View Controller design patterns, DRY and SRP principles.
* Agile principles, pair programming, stand-ups, retros and sprint planning.
* Various computer based languages such as Ruby and JavaScript.
* Group based projects to develop our programming skills in a workplace environment.
* Sharing knowledge as a Mentor to students in newer cohorts.

#### East 15 Acting School (2009 to 2013)

* First Class degree in BA Acting and Contemporary Theatre.
* Subjects included. Devising, clowning, voice over, dance, physical theatre, puppetry, singing, movement, gymnastics, script writing and directing.

## Where I've Worked ( Experience )
          
**Samuel Rhodes School** (Feb-2020 to Dec-2021)  
_Class Room Teaching Assistant_

* Working with secondary and college aged students with a range of special educational needs and disabilities. Using my skills of empathy to understand and work with the students tp help them achieve all of their potential. Being neurodivergent myself and displaying my own personal skills I showed them that no matter their diagnosis, everyone has a personal basket of skills that are just as valid and valued as others. The students confidence grew, and they achieved things even they couldn't have imagined. Learning how to make a meal from scratch, by themselves, and serving it up to their peers.

* Lead Class TA and 1:1 with students to provide a safe and nurturing environment in which the students could excel and feel self empowered. Using my skills of leadership and exeperience with specific SEND diagnosis, I was often tasked with training and mentoring new TA's. I was able to instill in them the best practices, and understanding of the students needs. So both the TA and the student were able to work in a safe environment. I was also asked to provide feedback to both higher management as well as the TA I was training, so the students accessibility needs were our top priority. This helped maintain a culture of constant improvement and development for everyone.

* Led communication and self independence lessons where I built tailor made resources from scratch. Using my skills of initiative I was able to understand the students specific learning needs, and was able to build and deliver resources to their learning levels, but also engaging enough so they would enjoy what they were doing. I also made resources that visually showed the students class structure, and broke their daily tasks down into simple to understand chunks. I was asked to deliver my resources to other classrooms so the students were provided with coherent structure across all subjects. This caused the students to engage more in classes and to alleviate anxiety within the students.

**Sugarman Education** (Dec-2013 to Feb-2020)  
_Agency Class Room Teaching Assistant_

* Worked with primary and secondary aged students with a range of special educational needs and disabilities, as well as emotional needs. Using my adaptability skills I was able to work in a range of different schools and enviorments that would often change from day to day. As an agency member of staff I was often told that the students warmed to me quickly and I was often asked to return on several occassions. This resulted in the students staying focused and showing no signs of anxiety around working with someone new.

* Worked at a range of different schools from primay SEN, primary mainstream 1:1 with an SEN pupil. To secondary SEN pupil referral units dealing with behaviour as well as social and emotional skills. Using my skills of resilience and compassion I was able to withstand threats and attacks, of being hit, bit or spat on, while still reassuring the student that they weren't in trouble and that everything was going to be alright. On several occassions I was able to defuse situations which would have ended up putting the students safety in danger.


## What I do for fun ( Hobbies )

* **Reading:** I like to read sci-fy and fantasy novels, I'm eagerly awaiting Patrick Rothfuss' highly anticipated "The Doors of Stone." as well as Pierce Brown's final book in the Red Rising Saga "Lightbringer".
* **Board/Table top games:** Current favourite board game is "The Quacks of Quedlinburg." where you play as charlatans or quack doctors brewing potions adding ingredients one at a time. I also enjoy communal story telling games and RPGs, such as "D&D", "Call of Cthulhu" as well as "Ten Candles". 
* **Video games:** Currently sailing the seven seas as a rag tag crew of salty sea dogs in "Sea of Thieves" coordinating plundering, riddle solving and treasure hunting with friends from a far.
* **Bouldering:** Mastering the basics from V0 to V3 while socialising with friends and strangers a like. Building that all needed hand strength for improved code writing.
* **Table Tennis:** A social player who gets increasingly competative the longer the game goes on. Helluva a serve, but I've been told I hold the racket weird.
